# US COVID-19 Dashboard

https://schnerd.github.io/us-covid-dashboard/

Built using data from New York Times: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

"Daily New Cases" and "Daily New Deaths" are calculated by taking the difference between the "cases"/"deaths" value of that day and the day before.
